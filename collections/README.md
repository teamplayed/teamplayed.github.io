# OpenActive Concept Collections

As well as being ordered within the Concept hierarchy, activities can form part of an unstructured collection called Activity Concept Collections. Any activities, regardless of hierarchy, can be added to a collection and the same activity can be present in more than one grouping.

For example Swimming, Water Aerobics, and Water Polo might all be classified as "Water Sports". Water Polo and Football might also be grouped into a collection of "Team Sports"

This repository hosts Played collections
